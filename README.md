This repository contents a python script "TesterScriptThread.py" that is a functional code file to allow the interaction between a Ros core and a development board Arduino Uno, using Rosserial, thread library and the Arduino's serial communication.

Furthermore, this repo is part of a collection of files to improve communication through Arduino and Ros, afterward, I'll upload complements files to visualize the data recollected with Arduino using Rviz and Gazebo.

To run the script in ubuntu you must type on your shell:
~#yourpc@yourname: python /PathToFile/TesterScriptThreat.py
